# Energy Consumption Analysis Project

## Overview

The Energy Consumption Analysis project aims to analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within Ontario's Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations. Leveraging a comprehensive database of reported data, the project delves into trends, conservation effectiveness, and areas for improvement. The findings inform data-driven strategies to achieve climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into the following key components:

1. **Problem Statement:**
   - Analyzing energy usage and GHG emissions in Ontario's BPS.
   - Identifying trends and assessing conservation effectiveness.

2. **Tools Used:**
   - Python, Jupyter Notebook for data analysis.
   - Excel for data preprocessing.
   - PowerBI for interactive visualizations.

3. **Approaches:**
   - **Data Cleansing:** Ensured the integrity and consistency of the dataset.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovered insights through visualization and statistical analysis.

4. **EDA Insights:**
   - Explored energy consumption trends, GHG emissions profiles, conservation impact, and operational efficiency.
   - Dedicated PowerBI tab showcasing the top 10 cities and organizations contributing to energy consumption.

5. **Conclusion/Suggestion:**
   - Considerations for predictive modeling to anticipate future energy consumption patterns.
   - Recommendations for proactive conservation strategies.
